= dotme - The dotfile manager

== DESCRIPTION

DotMe keeps configuration files (a.k.a. dotfiles) under version control (git)
and installs symbolic links under your home directory. It's controlled via rake
commands (see USAGE for more information).

Where possible, custom configuration files (<tt><some-name>.mine</tt>) are
supported and included by whatever mechanism is provided by the respective
configuration system.


== USAGE

Change to the directory you installed dotme in (see INSTALL below), e.g.:

  cd ~/dotme

Install symlinks to dotfiles:

  rake install

Update codebase and symlinks (default task):

  rake [update]

Remove symlinks to dotfiles:

  rake uninstall

See a list of all available tasks:

  rake -T


== INSTALL

First, you need git[http://git.or.cz/] for dotme to function. Install it,
if you haven't already, and come back here.

Change to the directory you want to install dotme in, e.g.:

  cd ~

Clone branch master of dotme:

  git clone git://github.com/blackwinter/dotme.git

Change to the new directory and create an include/exclude file (optional,
but recommended):

  cd dotme
  vi inclexcl

    # i want vim and irb
    +vim
    +irb

    # and bash_aliases
    +bash/bash_aliases

    # but git only without gitignore
    +git
    -git/gitignore

Finally, install the symlinks:

  rake install


== ISSUES

* <tt>git-config</tt> replaces <tt>~/.gitconfig</tt> symlink with real file [1].
  So, if you update your git configuration through <tt>git-config --global</tt>,
  the config file will no longer be tracked by dotme. Instead, edit it directly.

  [1]<b> </b><http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2007/7/15/251676>

* <tt>git-config</tt> doesn't expand variables in <tt>~/.gitconfig</tt> file.
  See e.g. [2]. This means you have to update the <tt>name</tt>, <tt>email</tt>,
  and <tt>excludesfile</tt> settings in the configuration file. In particular,
  without the latter being adjusted you won't benefit from the shipped
  <tt>~/.gitignore</tt> file.

== CALL TO ACTION

If you want to contribute modifications to existing dotfiles or add some of
your own, just send me a patch or a pull request. The same goes for any bugs
or issues you find.
